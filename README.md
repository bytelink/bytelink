# Bytelink

Bytelink is a library project that provides an easy way to handle communication over sockets. This can be used for
sending data over sockets in games, server applications, or even chat apps.

This project is currently still very WIP, and it's not yet ready for production use of any kind. But we do accept pull
requests if you have something you want to add to the code, or if you just want to help us get the project to a working
state, allowing us to release it fully.
